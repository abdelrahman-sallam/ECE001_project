<p>  <b>3 G </b>
3 G or third generation mobile telecommunications are standards developed by the International Telecommunications Union for mobile phones and mobile telecommunications services which comply with the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specifications. Mobile features provide wide area wireless voice messaging, mobile Internet access, video calls and mobile television, all in a mobile environment. </p>

	<P> <b>Planetary Positioning System (GPS) </b>
The Global Positioning System ( GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth, where the sight of four or more GPS satellites is unhindered. The GPS software offers essential capabilities worldwide to military, civil, and commercial users. Furthermore, GPS is the foundation for modernizing the global air traffic network, weather systems, and local services. </P>

<p> <b> WiMAX  </b>
WiMAX (Microwave Access Worldwide Interoperability) is a wireless communications standard designed to deliver 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates, with the latest update providing up to 1 Gbit / s for fixed stations. It is part of a wireless networking system of fourth generation, or 4G. WiMAX far exceeds the 30-meter wireless range of a traditional Wi-Fi Local Area Network ( LAN) with a propagation radius of about 50 km. WiMAX provides data transfer rates that can be higher than traditional cable-modem and DSL links, but the bandwidth must be shared between multiple users, resulting in lower practical speeds. </p>

<P> <b> Communication near field </b>
Near Field Communication ( NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices, typically no more than a few centimeters, to create radio contact with each other by touching them together or bringing them close. Current and expected applications include contactless transactions, data sharing and simpler setting up of more complex communications like Wi-Fi. Communication between an NFC system and an unpowered NFC chip is also possible, called a "tag" </P>

<p><b> Long Duration Evolution (LTE) </b>
LTE is a wireless, high-speed data communication standard for mobile phones and data terminals. It is based on the network technologies GSM / EDGE and UMTS / HSPA, increasing efficiency and speed by using modern modulation techniques. This is related to the 4th Generation (4 G) technologies being introduced. </p>
