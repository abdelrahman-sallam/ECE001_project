Outsiders gain access to steal vital data from companies, which is a major hindrance in rolling out mobile computing services.Issues involving unauthorized access by hackers to data and information, is also a huge problem. Outsiders gain access to stealing vital data from companies, which is a major obstacle to mobile computing services being rolling out. No company wants to open its secrets to hackers and other intruders who sell the valuable information to their competitors in turn. It is also important to take the appropriate precautions to mitigate those threats 
<hr><h2><b><i><u> Some of those measures include</u></i></b></h2>
<hr><ul>
	<li>Hiring qualified personnel</li>
	<li>Installing security hardware and software</li>
	<li>Educating the users on proper mobile computing ethics</li>
	<li>Auditing and developing sound, effective policies to govern mobile computing</li>
	<li>Enforcing proper access rights and permissions</li>

<p>These are just a few ways to help deter any company's plans to offer mobile computing from possible threats. Since information is vital, all possible safeguard measures should be evaluated and implemented. 
Without such measures, it is possible to infiltrate exploits and other unknown threats, and cause irrefutable harm. There may be reputational or financial sanctions. In such cases, misuse of different unethical practices is very easy. 

If those factors are not worked on properly, it may be an avenue for constant hazard. There are still diverse threats to the implementation of this type of technology. </p>
